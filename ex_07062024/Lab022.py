#Data type - None Type

#Nothing
#None is not a default value for a variable. It is a value that means nothing. It is like a placeholder that you will use later. For example, in a game, if you want to represent that a player has not chosen a card yet, you can use None. It is a built-in constant in Python. You can use it to assign null values to variables or to check if a variable has a value or not. For example:
#None is not a string, integer, float, or boolean data type. It is a separate type of its own. You can use it to assign null values to variables or to check if a variable has a value or not. For example:
name = None
#None is not 0
#None is not an empty string
#None is not False
print(type(val))
#val = val+1 #No operations are allowed with None

#initially if we don;t know about the value of a variable then we can assign it None. It is a built-in constant in Python. You can use it to assign null values to variables or to check if a variable has a value or not. For example:
name = "" #Empty string, some memory is allocated to it
name = None #No memory is allocated to it
print(name)
name = "Sachin"
print(name)
